Disguard aims to solve the problem of Discord scamming by crowdsourcing scammer accounts and domains reported by users. Put simply, the more servers it joins, the safer Discord becomes. Disguard also considers hacked accounts, and allows users to report those seperately. Server owners are in full control of what to do when a scammer is detected in their server, and can configure Disguard to auto-ban/kick/mute or just warn a moderator.
