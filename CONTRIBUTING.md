Thanks for contributing to Disguard! Together we can bring an end to Discord scams.

## I found a bug

If you believe you've found a bug, please report it using our [issue tracker](https://github.com/TheOtterlord/disguard). Please provide logs, screenshots, and anything else related to your problem.

## I have a feature request

If you'd like to request a feature, open a feature request in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/TheOtterlord/disguard/issues) explaining what your feature is, and how it improves the experience. These requests do not guarantee your feature will be implemented. The community is free to discuss the feature, making suggestions, showing support or critisism. A developer may then implement the feature if it is accepted by the project maintainer(s).

## I'd like to implement a feature, or fix a bug

Sure! We love to see code contributions, and would be welcome to see a bug fix, or feature implementation.

If you're fixing a bug, it's polite to comment on the GitHub issue to say you are working on this problem. This prevents people from making 2 PRs for the same fix. Please also tag the issue in your pull request so we can better see what it is you're fixing.

If you're implementing a feature, it's best to check if the feature has been greenlit by a maintainer. If not, your pull request might not be accepted if the maintainer(s) elect to not add the feature. If it has been greenlit, and you decide to work on this feature, it's polite to comment on the GitHub issue to say you are working on this feature. This prevents people from making 2 PRs for the same feature. Please also tag the related issue in your pull request so we can better see what it is you're adding.
